PharmaCompass: Neuro-Symbolic Information Extraction & Clinical Trial Matching

PharmaCompass is an end-to-end hybrid Neuro-Symbolic AI framework designed to bridge the gap between unstructured clinical text and formal semantic knowledge bases. By combining the generative power of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) with the strict deductive capabilities of Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontologies, PharmaCompass automates medical data extraction and accurately matches patient profiles to complex clinical trials.

🌟 Key Features

Generative Information Extraction: Fine-tuned Llama-2-7B using QLoRA (4-bit quantization) on MIMIC-III discharge summaries to produce structured, verifiable medical profiles in JSON format.

Robust Knowledge Graph Population: Automated pipelines built with owlready2 that ingest parsed model predictions, execute validation checks, and populate a semantic medical ontology (.owl).

Description Logic Reasoning: Integrates the HermiT Reasoner to run automated logical inference across patient attributes, dynamically filtering and matching eligible candidates for targeted clinical trial criteria.

Interactive Prototype: Features a full-fledged GUI powered by Gradio for real-time clinical text processing, extraction, and trial eligibility checking.

Academic Evaluation: Rigorously tested using Gold Standard benchmarks with fully tracked metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).

🛠️ System Architecture Diagram & Pipeline

The PharmaCompass pipeline consists of four major sequential stages:

Fine-Tuning & Inference: Unstructured patient records $\rightarrow$ Quantized Llama-2-7B Adapter $\rightarrow$ Structured JSON Output.

Ontology Ingestion: JSON Parser $\rightarrow$ Instantiation of Classes (Patients, Medications, Conditions) $\rightarrow$ Populated Ontology.

Semantic Inference: Populated OWL File $\rightarrow$ HermiT Reasoner DL Execution $\rightarrow$ Logical Classification.

Clinical Matching: Execution of Trial Rules $\rightarrow$ Verified Cohort Identification.
